Use DFS can solve with all 10s

## 1. Graph Coloring

- [x] Heuristic. (Can pass the assignment, but not all 10s)
    - Consider the degree of nodes
    - Consider possible coloring options for nodes
- [x] Backtracking, for dense graph, it takes too long time to get a solution.
- [ ] Local search with designed objective
